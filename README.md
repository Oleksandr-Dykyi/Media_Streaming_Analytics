## Media_Streaming_Analytics

#### Technology Stack:
Amplitude (cohort creation, data visualization, dashboard creation)

#### Project Description:
In this project, I harnessed the capabilities of Amplitude to perform detailed media streaming analytics.

I initiated the project by crafting a cohort with specific criteria:
Country: USA
Platform: iOS or Android
Users who completed the Welcome action for the first time during June 2023, determined using historical data.

Based on this cohort, I generated the following visualizations:
1. A user onboarding funnel, comprising steps from Welcome to Play Song or Video, segmented by platform.
2. A retention graph tracking users from the Welcome event to any active event and Play Song or Video, presented as a bar chart.
3. Onboarding funnel conversion rates per day, categorized by platform.
4. User onboarding time per day, dissected by platform.
5. Dynamics of daily user counts for Play Song or Video and any active event.
6. Average events per user per day, encompassing any active event and Play Song or Video.

To streamline data exploration, I consolidated the cohort and these graphical representations into a dashboard, making necessary date range adjustments.

Additionally, I created a Customer Journey Map (CJM) visualizing the user's session progression, starting from the initial session to Play Song or Video.
